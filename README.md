# UBC Give

## Project Overview

Our application domain is a local community item exchange,” inspired by “Buy Nothing” Facebook groups.
Users will be able to give away and request items for free by creating posts in certain categories with a location and pickup time. 
They will also be able to review other users, receive announcements sent out by moderators, and file support tickets.
Reviews for users will be taken down by moderators if they contain offensive or profane content.
Moderators can also flag and suspend accounts, and they can announce broadcasts. 

## Our Impetus 
This system will help solve SDG goal 12, responsible consumption and production, in our university.
People constantly move in and out and their needs change rapidly.
Our application is called “UBC Give” to reduce waste and offer things in need with a community-based, generous attitude.
Our application will foster a free spirit of giving what isn’t used and receiving what is needed.

## Who We Are
We are three UBC undergraduate students -- Louise Cooke, Amy Liu, and Krish Thukral -- who enjoy a good cup of matcha.
